 * httpserver.h (0.9.0)
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   A single header C library for building non-blocking event driven HTTP
 *   servers
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Do this:
 *      #define HTTPSERVER_IMPL
 *   before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
 *   implementation.
 *
 *   // i.e. it should look like this:
 *   #include ...
 *   #include ...
 *   #include ...
 *   #define HTTPSERVER_IMPL
 *   #include "httpserver.h"
 *
 *   There are some #defines that can be configured. This must be done in the
 *   same file that you define HTTPSERVER_IMPL These defines have default values
 *   and will need to be #undef'd and redefined to configure them.
 *
 *     HTTP_REQUEST_BUF_SIZE - default 1024 - The initial size in bytes of the
 *       read buffer for the request. This buffer grows automatically if it's
 *       capacity is reached but it certain environments it may be optimal to
 *       change this value.
 *
 *     HTTP_RESPONSE_BUF_SIZE - default 1024 - Same as above except for the
 *       response buffer.
 *
 *     HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT - default 20 - The amount of seconds the request
 * will wait for activity on the socket before closing. This only applies mid
 *       request. For the amount of time to hold onto keep-alive connections see
 *       below.
 *
 *     HTTP_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT - default 120 - The amount of seconds to keep a
 *       connection alive a keep-alive request has completed.
 *
 *     HTTP_MAX_TOTAL_EST_MEM_USAGE - default 4294967296 (4GB) - This is the
 *       amount of read/write buffer space that is allowed to be allocated
 * across all requests before new requests will get 503 responses.
 *
 *     HTTP_MAX_TOKEN_LENGTH - default 8192 (8KB) - This is the max size of any
 *       non body http tokens. i.e: header names, header values, url length,
 * etc.
 *
 *     HTTP_MAX_REQUEST_BUF_SIZE - default 8388608 (8MB) - This is the maximum
 *       amount of bytes that the request buffer will grow to. If the body of
 * the request + headers cannot fit in this size the request body will be
 *       streamed in.
 *
 *   For more details see the documentation of the interface and the example
 *   below.
 *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */
